# Email-Template-Gaudiinc
First Email Template for Gaudiinc 
All the CSS was internal and I used a CSS inliner (Campaign Monitor) when sending out the email to customers. 
Fully responsive and works on mobile too. Working on getting better at optimizing this tempalte and existing templates to better suit all email clients. The images, banner, logo were all designed as well using Canva. P{lease see the master branch for code.
